            My name is <span class="highlight">Lan Dam</span>.  I'm an experienced data analyst with a wide skill sets in data analysis and system engineering looking to transition into the field of data science or software development.  Toward this goal, I've completed a data science certificate program from the University of Washington and is currently enrolled in the software development program offered by Epicodus.com.<br><br>

            In my previous employment at the Boeing Company, I've demonstrated the ability to quickly learn new tools and processes in many disciplines.  I works well in multi-site, cross functional teams, as well as independently with minimal direction.  I'm equally comfortable working on long programs as well as small agile projects.  I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques.<br><br>

            In my free time I enjoy playing most sports, including basketball, football, tennis, and golf among others.  I also do many other seasonal activites like snowboarding, hiking, and kayaking as weather permitted.  At home I like to play video games and read books.

                An analysis of basketball shot selection during the 2014-2015 NBA season using R.  This analysis examined the next shot attempt following a successful or missed shot to determine if there's a bias.

                In this project I was introduced to bootstrap.  I learned how to use bootstrap to create a variety of panels and its grid system.  I also learned how to add my own custom styles on top of bootstrap.

                I attempted to replicate the main page of the English wikipedia.com site.  This was done using a series of grid layout and panels.  I also learned how to implement nav bar using bootstrap.
